n8n Workflow Popularity System
Analyze, compare, and expose the popularity of n8n workflows across multiple platforms.
This project collects popularity signals from:
YouTube — views, likes, comments, engagement ratios
n8n Community Forum (Discourse) — replies, likes, contributors, views
Google Trends — search interest across regions
All results are stored in a structured JSON dataset and exposed through a FastAPI REST API.
A cron-ready script simulates automated updates.
